Role: *API Product Owner*
---------------------------

### Persona 
<!--Name of stakeholder (of architecture and architectural artifacts) and its main concerns-->
An API product owner is at the intersection where API clients and providers meet. This leads to a constant struggle between fulfilling clients' wishes and keeping the API on [POINT](https://ifs.hsr.ch/index.php?id=15667&L=0) and economically viable.

<!-- We decided to call it API Product Owner based on various definitions we found:

* [Broadcom](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/ca-enterprise-software/layer7-api-management/api-portal-legacy/3-5/manage-the-api-portal/functionality-by-user-role/internal-roles.html): API Owner: The person within your organization tasked with defining, publishing and monetizing, or promoting your APIs. On the API Portal, this person will be responsible for: ..

* [DZone](https://dzone.com/articles/api-ownership-for-the-modern-enterprise) has a Business API Owner and Technical API Owner

* [Tyk](https://tyk.io/essentials-of-api-product-ownership/) has the API product owner as a specialization of the product owner.

* [Apigee](https://medium.com/apis-and-digital-transformation/without-an-api-product-owner-your-apis-have-a-limited-lifespan-6df98d6ad281) has a "API product owner" and describe them as "Essentially, API product owners are the end-user advocate — and that’s for both for developers using the APIs and the people touching the applications powered by those APIs." 

-->

### Information and Modeling Need
<!-- derived from role responsibilities (articulated in the form of user stories)-->

API product owners care about and require/produce information related to: 

* Stakeholder concerns
* User experience
* Documentation, for example product roadmaps and API descriptions 
* Service level agreements
* Quick overviews of external interfaces and internal structure of the produced software.
* Cost vs. benefit of feature development, supportability and evolvability of their products and services.

<!-- TODO (ongoing): Revisit and complete as activities and artifacts evolve. -->
