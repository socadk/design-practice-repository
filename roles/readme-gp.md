## DPR: *Roles*

a.k.a. Software Engineering/Service Design Personas

### Context and Motivation 

Practices are employed by people on projects and/or building products; these people have one or more roles and responsibilities in their organizations. These role/persona descriptions will be kept light here, unlike in more traditional methods such as (R)UP or IBM UMF: 

1. Names of stakeholders (of architecture and architectural artifacts) and their main concerns.
2. Information and modeling need, derived from role responsibilities (articulated in the form of user stories) and [activities](../activities) performed.
3. [Artifacts](../artifact-templates) produced and consumed, including templates, practices, and techniques applied to do so.

The third rule of method adoption applies (the first two laws can be found in the activities and artifact folders): 

> *Context matters: what works for one role in a particular client, team, and project environment might be the root of all evil elsewhere.*

See Part 1 of Olaf Zimmermann's [ICWE 2020 presentation](https://ozimmer.ch/assets/presos/ZIO-ICWEKeynoteWADEC3v10p.pdf) for more information on the importance of context during design and [decision making](https://ozimmer.ch/practices/2020/04/27/ArchitectureDecisionMaking.html).


### Overview/Inventory (Genetic and Specific Roles)

We have identified a number of roles already, but only documented two of them so far (DPR puts more emphasis on the artifact templates and activities than on the role descriptions).

#### Generic roles (not specific/limited to service design):

  * Technical Team Lead
  * Product Owner/Manager
  * Business/Domain Analyst
  * [Application and Integration Architect](./DPR-ApplicationArchitectRole.md) 
  * System Integrator  
  * Infrastructure Architect
  * Security Architect/Specialist
  * Developer ("full stack", specialized)
  * DevOps Specialist (CI/CD, provisioning)
  * Tester 
  * Auditor (e.g., System and Process Assurance Auditor)
  * Maintainer (e.g., Legacy System Modernizer)

#### API/service design roles:

  * [API Product Owner](./SDPR-APIProductOwner.md)
  * Cloud Application Architect 
  * Service Designer 
  * API Developer (Backend Developer) 
  * API Client Developer (Frontend Developer)
