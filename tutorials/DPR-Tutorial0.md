# *DPR* Tutorial 0: Quick Start

## First Steps and Orientation

Let's assume you have been assigned the role of API product owner for a fictitious online shop and its APIs. 

1. Consult the [API Product Owner](../roles/SDPR-APIProductOwner.md) role description here in DPR to find out what it is about: on the role page, navigate to the tasks typically performed by this role at project initiation.
2. Create a [User Story](../artifact-templates/DPR-UserStory.md) as a sample artifact. 
3. Perform the activity [SMART NFR Elicitation](../activities/DPR-SMART-NFR-Elicitation.md). 

You can now explore DPR on your own by following the links between activities and artifacts. If you can't find what you are looking for, please create an issue or, even better, a pull request that has the missing method content (templates are available in [this folder](../contributing)).

Alternatively, please move on to [Tutorial 1](DPR-Tutorial1.md), API design in an online shop scenario.
