## *DPR:* Background information 

These are the design principles and guidelines for [DPR](../README.md):

* Get inspired by structure and terminology of OMG SPEM and traditional methods like IBM Global Services Method/Unified Method Framework UMF and the Unified Process, but also contain information found in the [Agile subway map](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/subway-map-to-agile-practices/) and underlying glossary/practice collection available at the Agile Aliance
* Integrate or point at resources from other methods and templates, for instance, ADD, arc42, C4 (as umbrella, defined goals and gives choices), blended with [ZIO](https://ozimmer.ch/index.html)'s insights 1995 to present <!-- DAD,  RCDA removed from list for v1 -->
* Complement this content with fresh, up-to-date content from personal experience and online resources
* Prefer a practice collection over a closed, formal/full method(ology):
    * Roles are not formally defined, but represent stakeholder personas with information/specification/review needs
    * Be open and lean by design, so never finished (and delivered as a repo)

We follow a *PEACH* model: 

* *P*ragmatism, 
* *E*ngineering Spirit (repeatable process, from analysis and spec to design and impl), 
* *A*daptability (by context, according to preferences and culture), 
* *C*ourage (e.g. to leave things out or do them differently, disclose sources/reference input; reusing (aka "stealing") material is typically ok in an open source-minded community, but with acknowledgment), 
* *H*onesty (ethics such as no cheating, no black-and-white argumentation, no false enemy (see Agile! book for correct term), see consulting code of conduct). If you do not comply, you risk impeachment ;-) 

More snippets of method engineering and usage principles are:

* "It depends" as an answer to a difficult question is not (always) an excuse, context does matter. But one should always be able to list some criteria! 
* There is a specification continuum, see this [report from a EuroPLoP 2017 focus group](https://www.vanheesch.net/papers/eplop17-FG-continuousSWD.pdf), featuring the notion of *document refactoring* and related smells: document are never finished but, but leaving them blank does not make sense either e.g. for non-functional requirement specifications 
* The notion of a "topic backlog" has been proposed: things to be thought about and worked upon, not necessarily features only <!-- (see what S. Ambler and P. Kruchten have to say) -->


### Application Examples, Links to other Method and Repositories

* The demo [Domain-Driven Service Design with Context Mapper and MDSL](https://ozimmer.ch/practices/2020/06/10/ICWEKeynoteAndDemo.html) take you from user stories to running microservice architecture in seven (plus two) steps.
* [MAP tutorial 2](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/tutorials/#tutorial-2) (not public yet, but access can be granted upon request) features a good share of the tasks describes in this repository.
* The [DDD crew](https://github.com/ddd-crew/) repositories and templates for business-level Domain-Driven Design (DDD). A great place to start is [Domain-Driven Design Starter Modelling Process](https://github.com/ddd-crew/ddd-starter-modelling-process) 
* Sam Newman's second book "Monolith to Microservices" features database decomposition patterns 
* The [Service Cutter wiki](https://github.com/ServiceCutter/ServiceCutter/wiki) collects coupling criteria 
* The [Build APIs You Won't Hate](https://apisyouwonthate.com/books) on LeanPub features a simple but effective resource identification technique
* [Rational Unified Process (RUP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process) and its "little brother" [OpenUP](https://download.eclipse.org/technology/epf/OpenUP/published/openup_published_1.5.1.5_20121212/openup/index.htm)

### A bit of method history

This section certainly is incomplete; please send additions via pull requests if you miss a method you have applied or created.

Methods from the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s:

* Structured Analysis (SA)
* Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD), supported by a number of methods such as Booch, OMT, OOSE and later converged and unified in UML and the Unified Process (UP) 
* Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM) frameworks and methods such as TOGAF and Zachman

And the 2000s:

* [Agile practices](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/agile-glossary/), including proposals for scaling agile such as SAFe
* Strategic and tactic [Domain-Driven Design (DDD)[https://dddcommunity.org/] (OOAD continuation/extension)
* Software architecture templates and notations (see this [state of the art and the practice report as of 2016](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7725214) for more): 
    * [arc42](https://arc42.org/)
    * [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) 
    * [ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 templates](http://www.iso-architecture.org/ieee-1471/templates/)
* SOA methods 
    * SOAD proposal ([HTML](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-soad1/), [PDF](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-soad1/ws-soad1-pdf.pdf))
    <!-- * SOMA and similar proprietary methods (see this paper) -->
* [Unified Architecture Method (UAM)](http://www.unified-am.com/)    


### Personal toolboxes (general purpose, not limited to service design)

Ordered alphabetically: 

* George Fairbanks, [Arch. Haikus](https://www.georgefairbanks.com/software-architecture/architecture-haiku/) and more 
* Michael Keeling, Design It! book and [blog](https://www.neverletdown.net/)
* Michael Stal's [Hitchhiker's Guide to Software Architecture and Everything Else](http://stal.blogspot.com/)
* Rebecca Wirfs-Brockâ€™s blog [The Responsible Designer](http://wirfs-brock.com/blog/)
* [Olaf Zimmermann's take](./olzzio.md)


## More Information 
<!--
Here are some additional resources and references:

* Agile Modeling by Scott Ambler
* OpenUP, the open source version of Rational Unified Process (RUP) - even if you are not fond of processes and artifact templates, you will find useful advice in it, e.g. under practices and guidance 
* The Tyree/Akerman template for AD capturing as published in an article in IEEE Software (which, according to the article, is inspired by the IBM template for architectural decision capturing as applied in an e-business Reference Architecture from IBM; see this SATURN presentation for other exemplary usages of the IBM template)
* The IBM Architecture Description Standard (ADS) that dates back to the late 1990s. ADS was introduced in an article in the IBM Systems Journal and got referenced e.g. in this MSDN article.
* The Pragmatic Bookshelf website, many resources for developers, architects and other roles in software engineering
* Collection of essential practices and checklists in SEMAT
* OMG SPEM for method terminology and method engineering (e.g. in software engineering research)

[arc42](https://arc42.org/) is a rich 12-section template for architecture descriptions. It comes with many hints, examples of SMART quality attributes, and much more. Many of the general purpose artifacts in DPR also appear in arc42.

See this [presentation](https://sagra2016.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/zio-towardsopenleanarchitectureframework-sagranov2016v10p.pdf) and this [IFS website](https://ifs.hsr.ch/index.php?id=13195&L=4)<!-- >, [blog post]() --> for more pointers.
