Artifact/Template: Candidate Endpoint List (CEL)
------------------------------------------------
also known as: Preliminary Endpoint List, Draft API Plan, Initial API Roadmap, Resource Candidates <!-- from MAP -->

### Motivation (Addressed Information Need) 
<!-- copy-pasted from https://internal.microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/identification/CandidateEndpointList.html TOOO decide pattern/method split, pattern has more content already -->

Let us articulate the need for this artifact in question form: 

*How can an initial, draft set of API capabilities (i.e., responsibilities, collaborations) be compiled and structured as these capabilities are identified in new requirements, design artifacts and descriptions of existing systems (for instance, domain-driven designs, user interface mockups, integration stories)?*


### Usage (Produced and Consumed When)

Step 4 in the [stepwise API/service design activity](../activities/SDPR-StepwiseServiceDesign.md) in DPR concetns service layer design. The API provides the remote facades.

<!-- * Step 3 of the EXPOSE technique -->

Mike Amundsen's [seven-step Web API design method](https://www.infoq.com/articles/web-api-design-methodology/) starts with "List all the things"; this activity roughly corresponds to Steps 1 to 3 in DPR.

<!-- TODO (v2) cite @Lauret:2019 here (see signs of use section ) -->


### Template Structure and Notation(s)
<!-- 
(rather detailed and does not match example, so moved to REL artifact):

Record your analysis (and design) results in list or table form: 

| Integration Type (Foundation pattern) | Visibility (Foundation pattern)| API/Endpoint Name | Source (Artifact) | Features/Capabilities (Responsibility Analysis) |  
|------------------|------------|------|--------|--------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
-->

A simple table like this will suffice: 

| Endpoint | Operation | Responsibility/Exposed Data | 
|----------|-----------|-----------------------------|
|...|...|...|


### Example(s)
MAP tutorial 2 (which is not yet published on the MAP website yet) provides a customer master-data management example. In the tutorial, the following user story complemented with architectural context information, NFRs, and a simple domain model) provides the primary input to the [API design activities](../activities/SDPR-StepwiseServiceDesign.md):

> "As a customer of Lakeside Mutual, I would like to update my contact information myself online so that I can make sure that the data is entered correctly and I do not have to call an agent, which may involve long waiting times."

The CEL identifying the API design and frontend-backend integration needs derived from this story looks like this (note that HTTP verbs are already called out, which is a little early but ok on candidate level):

| Endpoint | Operation (HTTP verb)  | Responsibility/Exposed Data | 
|----------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Customer | Find (GET)  | Returns list of identifiers of customers that match some search criteria |
|          | Read (GET)  | Returns details of one particular customer record |
|          | Update (PUT)| Allows client to change all or parts of a customer record (for instance, address and context information) |


### Tools
Any plain text or Markdown editor, wikis, presentation tools and even spreadsheets can be used to create and populate CEL tables, as long as they provide some support for table editing.


### Hints and Pitfalls to Avoid
Taking the output of Step 3 in our seven-step approach (or equivalent output of another business analysis and architecture design method) into account, you may want to follow the following steps when populating the CEL table (and, in the next step, the [Refined Endpoint List (REL)](SDPR-RefinedEndpointList.md)): 
<!-- source: from MAP, unpublished so far -->

1. Add one candidate API per functional partition a.k.a *Subdomain* in DDD (@Evans:2003); note that some DDD literature also talks about *Bounded Contexts* here (@Vernon:2013); optionally, also add one candidate endpoint per *Entity* in a subdomain and/or *Aggregate* in a bounded context. <!-- TODO (v2.1) how about services too? see what GT SLR from UZ et al has to say -->
2. Add one candidate API per layer that crosses a physical tier boundary according to the chosen *client-server cuts* in the architecture; for instance, add one candidate API per client application? (as explained/motivated in the [*Backends-for-Frontends*](https://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/) pattern). <!-- TODO cite CSC patterns paper --><!-- removed here (v1): 3. Add one *candidate API client* per backend system to be integrated/required to implement the user/integration stories. -->
3. Refactor (merge, split) to remove redundant API/API endpoint entries and achieve high cohesion (w.r.t. business-/domain-level responsibilities) within endpoints. <!--, but do not refine to API operation/call level yet. -->
<!--
5. Add one *candidate API* per team shown as a *Team Bounded Context (TBC)* in a DDD context map; add one *candidate endpoint* per subteam. -->
<!-- not sure where previous one came from; F-A-S-T? see e2e demo -->

Additional rules of thumb (regarding the transition from DDD to API design (drawn from our experience and additional sources) are:

* Master data and transactional data go to different contexts/aggregates and, in turn, endpoints.
* Creation requests to Factories become POSTs.
* Entity modifiers become PUTs or PATCHes.
* Value Objects appear in the custom MIME types representing resources.

A general hint is not to hesitate to undo and revise as you learn more about the client's information needs and provider capabilities (both on CEL and REL level, as well as throughout all seven steps). 


### Origins and Signs of Use
Any design/documentation artifact in between a planning item/requirement specification (for instance, a user story) and annotated source code providing a RESTful HTTP (or similar) endpoint resource qualifies as a CEL.

The artifact appears in (@Sturgeon:2016) and also is a candidate pattern in MAP.

Chapter 2 of (@Lauret:2019) features an "API Goals Canvas", which is very similar to the CEL/REL artifacts in DPR.
