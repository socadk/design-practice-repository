## *DPR:* Activities in Service Design and Agile Architecting 

### Context and Motivation 
As responsible software engineers, we do not like to be bossed around. Decentralized decision making and autonomous teams might not be listed explicitly as values in the [Agile Manifesto](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/), but are certainly valued and practiced a lot in agile teams and organizations.

Agile does equal anarchy; agile teams actually are quite (self-)disciplined and employ a number of ceremonies (a.k.a. practices). Most of them are collected and commented upon elsewhere, for instance try the [Subway Map to Agile Practices](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/subway-map-to-agihle-practices/) and glossary by the Agile Alliance. Here in DPR, we focus on agile architecting and service/API design and collect some of the method elements, tactics, practices, etc. that served us well or that are frequently recommended, for instance in microservices books. These activities consume and produce the [artifacts](../artifact-templates) listed in a sibling folder, possibly supported by checklists and templates; they are owned and performed by one or more of the personas and [roles](../roles) also documented in this repository.

One should never forget the first rule of method adoption: 

> *If in doubt, leave it out (or: do not create a big ball of method mud).*


### Overview/Inventory of Activities Specific to Service/API Design

<!-- TODO (v2.1) add simple miro diagram (with hyperlinks!) here -->

Particularly relevant for service/API design are:

* [Strategic DDD](DPR-StrategicDDD.md) a.k.a. context mapping 
* [Tactic DDD](DPR-TacticDDD.md) and/or [event storming results](https://contextmapper.org/docs/event-storming/) and other analysis practices 
* *Featured:* [Stepwise/Incremental Service Design](SDPR-StepwiseServiceDesign.md) (contract-first)
* [User Interface Mocking](DPR-UserInterfaceMocking.md) (for APIs providing [Frontend Integration](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/foundation/FrontendIntegration) capabilities)
* Integration Story Telling (for [Backend Integration](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/foundation/BackendIntegration)) (to be continued)

<!--
* Service Modeling methods
    * MAP category on service identification (including DDD), not yet published
    * EIP integration flows (tbd)
 -->


### Overview/Inventory of Artifacts General Software Engineering/Architecture:

#### Architectural Analysis

* Analysis of Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs), both functional and quality-oriented. Activities may include:
    * Relevance assessment and prioritization, which can be supported by a checklist of ASR criteria (see [this blog post](https://medium.com/olzzio/architectural-significance-test-9ff17a9b4490) for the time being)
    * User Story-Based Iteration Planning, Story Mapping and [Story Splitting](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/split/) 
    * [Use Case](../artifact-templates/DPR-UseCase.md) Modeling (full vs. brief)
    * [SMART Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) Elicitation](DPR-SMART-NFR-Elicitation.md): <!-- TODO (v2.1) add "with CARGO as five meta qualities" -->
    * Value, risk and cost-based prioritization of NFRs, proposed and elaborated upon in an article by Martin Glinz ([PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3249473_A_Risk-Based_Value-Oriented_Approach_to_Quality_Requirements)) and very much in line with George Fairbank's advice on [Just Enough Software Architecture]().
    * Specification of [Agile landing zones](http://wirfs-brock.com/blog/2011/07/28/agile-landing-zones/) (Rebecca Wirfs-Brock) 
<!--
    * Quality story telling (two flavours: extended user story, standalone)
    * Quality storming (Michael Ploed) 
    * to be continued (e.g., PLANGUAGE, Sophisten templates) 
-->

#### Architectural Synthesis

* [Architecture Modeling](DPR-ArchitectureModeling.md)
    * "Architecture Overviewing" and Strategic Architecting
* Quality- and Pattern-Oriented Design 
	* [Attribute-Driven Design (ADD) 3.0](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=436536) 
	* Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture (POSA) book series, Volume 4 in particular @Buschmann:2007.
* Component Identification and Modeling 
    <!-- * C4 (which extend into C5+2, adding Connectors, Context and Concerns) -->
    * [Responsibility-Driven Design](http://www.wirfs-brock.com/PDFs/A_Brief-Tour-of-RDD.pdf) introduces role stereotypes and made CRC cards popular.
    * "UML Components" by J. Cheesman and J. Daniels suggests steps to advance from use cases to components @CheesmanDaniels:2000
* [Architectural Decision Capturing](./DPR-ArchitecturalDecisionCapturing.md)
    * Yielding [Y-statements](../artifact-templates/DPR-ArchitecturalDecisionRecordYForm.md), (M)ADRs or other forms of ADRs as artifacts 
    * Most Responsible Moment (MRM) scoring for ADs (dynamic?) <!-- MRM not LRM -->
* Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
    * Context Mapping in [Strategic DDD](DPR-StrategicDDD.md) <!-- and context maps (practice. vs. artifact) -->
    * [Tactic DDD](DPR-TacticDDD.md)
* User Interface (UI) Design
    * [User Interface Mocking](./DPR-UserInterfaceMocking.md)
* Coding the Architecture 
    * [Architecturally Evident Coding Styles](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/Presentation/2013_017_001_48651.pdf)
* Operational Modeling
<!-- * DevOps (or: ArchOps?) -->


#### Architectural Evaluation/Assessments

Both lean/light and full-fledged techniques have been proposed: 

* [Tiny Architectural Review Approach (TARA)](https://www.artechra.com/media/writing/JSS-Woods-IndustrialArchitecturalAssessmentUsingTARA.pdf)
* [Decision-Centric Architecture Reviews (DCAR)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6449237)
* [Architetcure Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_tradeoff_analysis_method)
<!-- * ARID (tbd) -->

<!-- * ZIO review Qs and advice (see Qs in mails to CS end of 2015) -->


#### Architectural Evolution

* Architectural Roadmapping, described by Eltjo Poort in an IEEE Software [Insights installment](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7725228?arnumber=7725228)
* Risk-driven prioritization, introduced in George Fairbank's "Just Enough Software Architecture"  <!-- (hoisting?) -->
* Thomas Ronzon's [Software Retrofit](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296480151_Software_Retrofit_in_High-Availability_Systems_When_Uptime_Matters)

Stefan Murer's book on "Managed Evolution" lists many more, and the [Evolution category in MAP]()collects patterns for API versioning and life cycle management.

#### Up the Elevator 

A number of frameworks and approaches for scaling agile exist, including: 

* [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/)
* [Large-scale Scrum (LeSS)](https://less.works/)
* [Disciplined Agile Delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disciplined_agile_delivery) <!-- at PMI now, less information available online -->
<!-- * to be continued -->

And Gregor Hohpe's IT/Software [Architect Elevator](https://architectelevator.com/) always is worth a ride.


## General Hints 

Some general hints for all design and modeling activities are: <!-- two typos on https://www.ifs.hsr.ch/index.php?id=13195&L=4 (in hint not copied here) -->

* Always write for a particular target audience (stakeholders with concerns) and model purposefully.
* Follow a "good enough" approach to decision making and documentation.
* Apply patterns and other reusable assets to reduce risk and cut cost.
* Make your methods [mighty](https://ecsa2020.disim.univaq.it/details/ecsa-2020-keynotes/3/Mighty-Methods-Four-Essential-Tools-for-Every-Software-Architect-s-Silver-Toolbox), both as a method engineer and as a method adopter.
* Practice [Situational Method Engineering](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220349352_Situational_Method_Engineering_State-of-the-Art_Review/link/0912f508a5a083e5bc000000/download) when creating new method elements (artifact description techniques, templates and so on). We hope we do... if not please [help us](../contributing/readme.md) get better!


## Tools

Many of the activities (techniques and practices, that is) collected in this repository are partially or fully supported by tools; these tools then help produce the output artifacts. 

Some of the ones we have contributed to, or work on, are:

* [Context Mapper](https://contextmapper.org/) for domain modeling
* Editor and linter for [Microservice API Description Language (MDSL)](https://microservice-api-patterns.github.io/MDSL-Specification/) for service contract design
* Architectural decision capturing and modeling: [MADR](https://github.com/adr/madr), [e-ADR](https://github.com/adr/e-adr), [ADMentor](https://github.com/IFS-HSR/ADMentor)

More specific information, also about other tools, can be found on the individual pages.
